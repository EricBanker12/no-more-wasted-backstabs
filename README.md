## No More Wasted Backstabs
Tera-Proxy module for Tera Online. Blocks targeted teleport skills without a target.
### Known Issues
* Using Brawler's skill: Meat Grinder on a target in-range but not knocked up will still consume the cooldown.
* Ninja's Decoy Jutsu and Valkyrie's Backstab are disabled by default as I have been unable to test them. They can be enabled in config.js.
### Requirements
[Tera-Proxy](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy) and dependencies
