## No More Wasted Backstabs
Tera-Proxy module for Tera Online. Blocks targeted teleport skills without a target.
### Known Issues
* Using Brawler's skill: Meat Grinder on a target in-range but not knocked up will still consume the cooldown.
* Using any skill with impassable terrain between you and your target in-range will still consume the cooldown.
